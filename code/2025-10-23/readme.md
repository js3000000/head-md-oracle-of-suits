Introduction to face detection using MediaPipe and weekly research documentation on the afternoon.

# Feedback for today
I couldn't achieve much for different reasons. Actually, I've been struggling with vibe coding because of hardware/software reasons and because I didn't really know what to do that could be really interesting with face detection or hands detection. Most of the think I thought about could have been achieved with a mouse or a controller.

Also I was frustrated, because I have lost many things because my computer crashed, because the IA replaced good things on the code that were working but then didn't, because I didn't added all my steps on github and also because it is hard for me to rollback to old version on githhub, etc...
